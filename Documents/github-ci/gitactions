Git hub actions to build ci/cd pipeline
=================================
Open your terminal and run

 npx create-react-app github-ci
 
 
 
 Open your project on your code editor
Create a repository on GitHub
Add the git remote origin to your project

git remote add origin https://github.com/Sangeetha2022/github-ci.git 

The next step is to create our Actions (workflow)

The action must be created inside a .github/workflow/ folder for it to be accessible by Github

To create the folder structure, run the command below inside the root of your project directory

mkdir .github/
mkdir .github/workflows/
